FIVE PEAKS WEBSITE REDESIGN

**STEP 1**
install nodejs to run website (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**STEP 2**
using terminal open the project folder, using 'cd C://where-you-extracted-the-zip-file'

**STEP 3**
The way I setup the project with github means you have to go to 'cd portfolio-react'

**STEP 4**
type 'npm start'

If the above command pops up an error, ensure you have installed nodejs (step one)

**Working?**
assuming everything went swimmingly your browser should automatically open up "localhost:3000" and The terminal should have printed 
```
You can now view five-peaks-website in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.0.198:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
